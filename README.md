## Compilation

**Here is the command to compile our code :**

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

## Tasks

- **Task 0 :** `push` (pushes an element to the stack), `pall` (prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack)
- **Task 1 :** `pint` (prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line)
- **Task 2 :** `pop` (removes the top element of the stack)
- **Task 3 :** `swap` (swaps the top two elements of the stack)
- **Task 4 :** `add` (adds the top two elements of the stack)
